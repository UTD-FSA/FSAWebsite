# Read-first, report-then-act

Before making any code change:
1. Read all relevant files first. Do not write or edit anything yet.
2. Report findings: what you found, root cause, and proposed fix options.
3. Wait for explicit authorization before implementing — do not assume the
   most obvious fix is wanted.

## Project conventions
- Comment blocks use DATA/UI headers, lowercase text.
- Headings are title-case; all other frontend copy is sentence-case (DESIGN.md § Typography > Capitalization).
- No orange. No purple glow/ring effects.
- CSV exports stay wired to status-filter arrays, never search-filtered arrays.
