                Several fields in the ading application collect information of a more personal nature. These include your thoughts on drinking, pamilya dealbreakers, MBTI type, and pamilya vibe preference. These fields are voluntary and exist solely to help officers make thoughtful pamilya placements.

                Membership dues and event ticket payments are primarily processed through Stripe. When you pay via Stripe, your card details are entered directly on Stripe&rsquo;s platform and are never transmitted to or stored on UTD FSA&rsquo;s servers. We retain a Stripe customer ID, checkout session ID, and payment intent ID to reconcile your payment status.
              </p>
              <p>
                The system also supports alternate payment methods — including cash, Venmo, and Zelle — which may be accepted at officer discretion. In those cases, the payment amount and method are recorded manually by an officer rather than processed automatically. No card details are collected for these methods.
              </p>
              <p>
                As of the date of this policy, all recorded payments have been processed through Stripe. Manual payment recording has not been used in production.

                When a non-member purchases tickets to a UTD FSA event, we collect the purchaser&rsquo;s name and email address, as well as the name and email address for each guest ticket. This information is used solely to generate, issue, and validate QR code tickets for event entry. Guests do not have an account on this website.
              </p>
              <p>
                The purchaser completing checkout is required to acknowledge this Privacy Policy before submitting payment. Guests whose information is provided by the purchaser — rather than entered by the guest themselves — are notified of this policy via a link included in the QR code ticket email sent to their address. If you are a guest and would like to request deletion of your data, please contact us at the address listed in the Contact section. Your request will be handled manually by an officer or administrator.

                Officers and administrators can access member application data and event registration records for purposes required to run the organization — including conducting pamilya matching, managing event check-in, and verifying membership. This access is provided through a server-side administrative client and does not expose one member&rsquo;s data to another member.
